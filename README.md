# Discord-QR-Scam

### About
A Python script that automatically generates a Nitro scam QR code and grabs the Discord token when scanned. This tool demonstrates how people can trick others
into scanning their Discord login QR Code, and gain access to their account. Use for Educational Purposes only.

## Usage
1. If you dont have python installed, download python 3.7.6
and make sure you click on the 'ADD TO PATH' option during
the installation.

2. Install the required modules > ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (Make sure you are in the same directory as the folder you downloaded it in.)

3. Type ```python QR_Generator.py``` in cmd to run

4. Wait for the `discord_gift.png` to be generated. Send the image to the victim and make them scan it.

5. When the QR Code is scanned, you will automatically be logged in to their account and the script will grab the Discord token.
